            <p>Born in San Francisco, Trevor began his lifelong love of music with the piano at age 4.  His journey eventually led him to Los Angeles at 19, where he became a staple of the professional music scene as a freelance keyboardist.  He later made a name for himself as the band leader and organist for the jazz/fusion trio Organ Freeman.<br/><br/>

Trevorâ€™s new album Use Your Inside Voice represents his debut not only as a solo artist, but as a singer and lyricist as well.  4 years in the making, it focuses on the intersection of emotion and heartbreak with a search for spirituality, meaning and inner peace.</p>
